# Arduino Firmware

The software for the arduino nano can be found here. Use the `nixie_driver.ino` to flash your arduino on the control pcb.

## PLEASE DONT USE `__nixie_driver_fix_for_clock_model_1.ino__`

This software verison is for my personal experimental nixie clock, where i can play with other hardware
